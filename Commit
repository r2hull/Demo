You can refine your response like this for better clarity and professionalism:

"I have moved this to the application.properties file. However, System.property is used internally in the JAR, so we need to set it every time. I will remove it once we have all the code for this JAR."

You can say:

"I checked the library, and there are no vulnerabilities."
