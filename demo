Nirmal Singh Gurjar MR is ready for review   https://gitlab.epay.sbi/epay/microservices/epay_transaction_service/-/merge_requests/1022/diffs
i am not sure if this MR is making any sense 
 
why we are doing any change in Transaction for this 
 
or am i missing anything 
 
i have not mentioned anywhere that we have to make any change like this... 
 
API was already there its just we need to create the client on Integration side or call it , if its related  to Validation API what we need to provide the merchant 


Nirmal Singh Gurjar updated the MR plz check

I can review this PR only, one i can see the Payment Booking API, because still i feel its not required this much changes...
