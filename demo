Currently, OTP verification logic checks whether the user is logging in or signing up.
As per the new requirement, this distinction is no longer needed.

Changes required:
- Remove login/signup based checks from OTP verification
- Allow any user to verify OTP and log in directly
- Update OTP logic as per the new flow


Simplified OTP verification logic for user login
