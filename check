Kafka Disconnection During Bulk Refund â€“ Immediate Fix Required

Hi DevOps,

Kafka is getting disconnected during the bulk refund upload for MID: 1000003 (around 09:44 AM).
Please find the attached logs clearly showing the disconnection and message publish failure.

Fix this on priority. This should not keep happening in SIT.
