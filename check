Subject: Request for Admin Access â€“ C Drive Full

Dear [IT/Admin Team],

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to inform you that my system's C drive is completely full, which is affecting my work performance. In order to free up space, I need to delete some unnecessary user profiles. However, I currently do not have the required admin access to perform this action.

Kindly grant me temporary admin access or assist in removing unused user profiles from the system.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Department/Team Name]
[Your Contact Info, if needed]
