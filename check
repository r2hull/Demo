Kafka Disconnection During Bulk Refund â€“ Fix Needed Immediately

Hi DevOps,

Kafka is getting disconnected during the bulk refund upload for MID: 1000003 (around 09:44 AM).
Logs clearly show disconnection and message publish failure.

Please fix this immediately. This cannot keep happening in SIT.
