The Search Refund Request module performs the following validations to ensure the request is accurate and secure before further processing:

Mandatory Field Check: merchantIdentifier is a required field and must not be null or empty.

Date Validation: fromDate and toDate, if provided, must not exceed the current system date. Additionally, if both dates are present, fromDate must be less than or equal to toDate.

Whitespace Validation: All input fields will be checked to ensure there are no leading or trailing single spaces.

Field Format and Length Validation: Fields such as atrnNumber, arrnNumber, and sbiOrderRefNumber will be validated against defined length and format constraints.

Enum Validation: refundStatus and refundType values will be validated against a predefined list of supported enum values to prevent invalid status/type entries.
